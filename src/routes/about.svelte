          <h3>**The Situation**</h3>
          <p>
            With 65% of the world‚Äôs üåê arable land Africa has the potential to
            feed the world. However, Agriculture currently only contributes 1/4
            to Africa‚Äôs GDP. With 19 being the average age in Africa, how do we
            make Agriculture "cool" and appealing to its young population to
            ensure it delivers on its potential to reverse the $47bn imports of
            food into Africa?

          <h3>**Our Solution**</h3>
          <p>
            Our platform rewards African youth for produce export with what they
            love the most, Crypto. We introduce a faster ‚ö° way to get paid,
            which reduces time to receive funds and increases trade. Making a
            sector typically viewed as "unsexy" attractive to youth, reversing
            the $47bn food trade deficit in the long run. This is the future of
            the African Agric industry projected to reach $1trn by 2030 (world
            bank).
